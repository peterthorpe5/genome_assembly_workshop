# genome_assembly_workshop
 
NAME: 
 
1) What was the best kmer value for the Velvet assembly? What was the N50 and number of scaffolds?
 
2) Why was this value the best compared to other extremely high or low values?
 
3) What was the best tools for this assembly? Why? (Comment: Combined 3 & 4)
 
4) Would this tool be suitable for a eukaryotic organism, if yes, why, if not, why?
 
5) What did we assemble (was was a mistery dataset)? From the header in the spades assembly, what was the rough coverage or reads? 
From the QC how many reads did we start with? What was the total length of the genome? Can you find some interesting facts about this organism?

6) Why is it important to trim the reads?
 
7) You will have to research this: Why can N50 be a bad measure for genome assembly quality metrics?
 
8) Research and name at least 5 other genome assembly programs.
 
9) Draw a graph of your assembly using Bandage and upload this on MMS.
 Email the linear and circular pdf of the genome diagram. Which do you prefer and why?
 
10) Write a short half a page feedback on the workshop and what you have learnt.

Create one document with your answers and upload it on MMS. Deadline is the 13th October 2020 17:00 BST
