# genome_assembly_workshop

NAME: 

1) What was the best kmer value for the Velvet assembly? What was the N50 and number of scaffolds?

2) Why was this value the best compared to other extremely high or low values?

3) What was the best tools for this assembly?

4) Why?

5) Would this tool be suitable for a eukaryotic organism, if yes, why, if not, why?

6) What did we assemble?

7) Why is it important to trim the reads?

8) You will have to research this: Why can N50 be a bad measure for genome assembly quality metrics?

9) Research and name at least 5 other genome assembly programs.

Draw a graph of your assembly using Bandage and email this. 

Email the linear and circular pdf of the genome diagram. Which do you prefer and why?

Write a short half a page feedback on the workshop and what you have learnt ....
